# What Music Do UWaterloo Students Listen To?

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the type of music UWaterloo students listen to.

## Introduction :cd:

As a huge music nerd, I'm constantly eager to find a new song or artist to listen to and I'm always curious about what plays in the headphones of other people. As an even bigger data and programming nerd, I can't help but to think about project ideas that excite me.

So, as a data visualization post for the University of Waterloo Data Science Club, I couldn't think of anything else better to explore than the relationship between music and the UWaterloo student body!
